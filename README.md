# ByteCode Designs Watcher
ByteCode Designs is a drop-shipping company that sells clothing that feature designs based on algorithms. The website used to have an experience bar that determined when new designs were released. This tool monitored the website, checking every 15 minutes to determine if any new sales had occurred. If a new sale was logged, this tool updated the current experience for the website, allowing me to track when new designs should be developed and released.
